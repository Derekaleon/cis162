    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>My name is Derek Leon, I am currently a student in my senior year at California State University Long Beach. 
        I am majoring in Business Administration, Managment and Information Systems. 
        I graduated from Cerritos College last year in the Spring of 2023 and got 
        my Associates degree in business administration. 
        I have taken a Java programming class before in Cerritos college and 
        I will keep taking programming courses here in my free time so that 
        I can enhance my knowledge in information technology. 
        As of now, I am taking a introductory to programming course in python 
        and an HTML & CSS course over this summer break. 
        In the future, I hope that I can obtain careers with everything that 
        I will learn in these classes and in the classes I will take at Cal State Long Beach. 
        Furthermore, I am really interested in pursuing a career in cybersecurity and 
        would like some insight from the Professor on what I can do right now to prepare 
        myself for a career in the field.</p>
