    <h1>My companys goal</h1>
    <img src="Earthlove_55_660x440_202202141745_1.png" alt="" >
    <p>In recent years, a heavy emphasis has been placed on our physical and mental well-being; 
        however, there is limited availability to clean, sustainable products that lead to long, healthy lives.
         With this shift in trends towards holistic solutions, 
         my brand aims to increase accessibility of preventative health measures to enhance livelihoods.</p>
         <p>The objective of my e-commerce site is to deliver health and wellness products to customers' doorsteps when they 
            subscribe to my service. When my customers subscribe to my website, 
            they will be able to customize their own health and wellness box with any healthy product they want delivered. 
            The contents inside these boxes can range from soaps, candles, healthy snacks, to skincare products, jewelry, books, 
            mindfulness products, vitamins and more.
